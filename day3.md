## [using data to inform IA and UX](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/62boQDrZyOe2eA)

Only 15% of fortune 500s are using their "big data"; very few companies overall use data. But data often gets ignored in favor of opinions.

Example: data tells you more people convert if you remove nav. Remove nav, but unintended consequence is frustrating your users and lowering your retention rate.

Proposing a framework for using data wisely:

 - **what question are we trying to answer?** Instead of "how do we increase conversions for this page?" ask "What's the best way to design this page?" Gets at multiple audiences
 - **how does that question relate to objectives?** What do we want people to do, how to interact, etc. Limit yourself to 5 perspectives, otherwise you spin wheels
     + business case: conversions. Data points: g'analytics conversions, heatmaps
     + user case: user satisfaction. Data points: user testing
     + marketing case: brand loyalty
 - **collect data** The first problem is collecting too much. Collect qualitative and quantitative data. 
     + Sources for quantitative: Analytics tools, product usage data, server logs. 
     + Sources for qualitative: user testing and surveys, user research, conversations with surrogates/people who interact with users.
     + Google analytics conversion/goals reports, conversion reports
 - **make a decision** It's easy for the people making the decision to only look at one perspective. What perspective will matter most? You and decision-makers need to decide that first, then prioritize that perspective.

The funnel: awareness > interest > desire > action/purchase > support > loyalty > advocacy

## The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: A Language of Critique for Information Architecture @stacysurla

Our work can be divvied up into 3 levels - the M3 model:

 - **Paradigms** - philosophical questions; overarching patterns, i.e. the sharing economy; active aging; cross-channel IA
 - **Theories and Models** - scientific problems; research-based tools, heuristics
 - **Solutions to problems** - practical problems; applied work.

## Adopting IA Heuristics and Iterative UX Reviews: A USPS.com Case Study - @jeffpass

Massive stats: 3 million visitors/day, $1 billion in revenue for 2015. Site sitting on an ancient terrible CMS that has been frankengineered to make a high-performing site.

 - Create a shared vocabulary.
 - Metrics 
 - use Abby's IA heuristics 
 - Know your tools, organize them, be their captain
 - Socialize your tools, over and over again

Always be [Knolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoll_(verb)): scan your environment for materials which are not in use; put away everythign not in use; group all like objects; align or square all objects

## #nobodyubersinthehood: Architecting for Inclusion in the Digital Service Economy

"If you aren't purposefully trying to identify and correct a problem, the bias is likely to creep into the project."

**Challenge of 2040** - the year when PoC will be the majority of the population of the U.S. More likely to be poor and urban, less likely to be served by digital. How we design must change to ensure the majority is not left out.

Chris Sacca - "greed case for diversity". Gender-diverse companies perform better financially. Ethnic/racial diversity at board level leads to 35% greater performance.

**Why focus on sharing/service economy?**

What are services?
 - Services are intangible, inseparable, perishable, inconsistent, customer involvement. 
 - Services are an immaterial exchange of value. (Cooper Design's give and get model). 
 - Services could also be seen as rented access: to goods, space, labor/expertise, shared physical environments, access to systems/networks

Service designers coordinate people, info, ideas, resources, energy/attention, capital

Sharing economy
 - generally perceived as positive
 - people agree 57% that access = ownership
 - many also say services are inconsistent and don't 100% trust it

Challenges of digitally mediated services:
 - separation between provider and consumer
 - intangible services have tangible impact on policy, cities
 - pursuit of data-driven design has "fixed" less than desirable behaviors
 - service employees treated as functionality rather than people

Services gone awry
 - get out of debt service acquired by high interest rate loan company
 - leap luxury bus service in SF - people didn't feel good about it

Most of the research on service/tech outcomes focuses on efficiency/productivity. But we need to focuse on outcomes that include shared value, quality of life, well-being, and sustainability goals.

Places that are doing good: 
 - good eggs - focuses on access in poor communities.  
 - Managed by Q offers hourly employees benefits!

The rise of the convenience class - paying for things we don't want to do. They give us back the one thing we can't get back: time.

From design thinking to accessibility thinking (A Web for Everyone from Rosenfeld). Using inclusive design principles.

Strategies for accessibility thinking:

 - best: universal design - one site - elements that work for everyone
 - okay: equivalent use - includes alternatives
 - not great: a separate, accessible version

Moving from projecting to infrastructuring: moving from designing things for specific people to designing Things

### Considerations for design for inclusion:

1. Automate users' best intentions. Alleviate thinking tasks that could result in unconscious bias being exercised on the part of users. 
    - Example: AirBNB instant book for minority guests being excluded
2. Inclusion, not intervention. Underserved populations want to feel a part of the respected mainstream. To include them, operate in the spirit of equitable use, where people aren't disadvantaged or stigmatized for their participation. Don't create digital poor doors.
3. Think mobile and android first. The smartphone has become the primary computing device of the poor. 10-15% of people use smartphones only for internet access.
4. Be near the action. Consider current knowledge and a person's ability to make inferences. Leverage tangible circumstances and familiar conventions to make your service useful. 
   - Example: jobsnap app, tinder for jobs but with video, allows users to submit video resumes to hourly employers within a certain mile radius.
5. Engage the urban landscape. Create design systems that work within ...
6. Elevate alternative means of accessing your service. 
    - Example: what if BlueApron accepted EBT?
