## using data to inform IA and UX

Only 15% of fortune 500s are using their "big data"; very few companies overall use data. But data often gets ignored in favor of opinions.

Example: data tells you more people convert if you remove nav. Remove nav, but unintended consequence is frustrating your users and lowering your retention rate.

Proposing a framework for using data wisely:

 - **what question are we trying to answer?** Instead of "how do we increase conversions for this page?" ask "What's the best way to design this page?" Gets at multiple audiences
 - **how does that question relate to objectives?** What do we want people to do, how to interact, etc. Limit yourself to 5 perspectives, otherwise you spin wheels
     + business case: conversions. Data points: g'analytics conversions, heatmaps
     + user case: user satisfaction. Data points: user testing
     + marketing case: brand loyalty
 - **collect data** The first problem is collecting too much. Collect qualitative and quantitative data. 
     + Sources for quantitative: Analytics tools, product usage data, server logs. 
     + Sources for qualitative: user testing and surveys, user research, conversations with surrogates/people who interact with users.
     + Google analytics conversion/goals reports, conversion reports
 - **make a decision** It's easy for the people making the decision to only look at one perspective. What perspective will matter most? You and decision-makers need to decide that first, then prioritize that perspective.

The funnel: awareness > interest > desire > action/purchase > support > loyalty > advocacy
