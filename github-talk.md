# github patchwork talk - notes

About me: Former geocities-ite, now web project manager. don't code much anymore, web dev tech is leaving me behind and that's okay. Thinking a lot about words lately. Love poop. 

uses for github:
 - documentation for projects: [both our internal projects](https://github.com/vculibraries/alertme) and [our open-source projects](https://github.com/vculibraries/alma-primo-customizations)
 - [collaborative policy-writing](https://github.com/erinrwhite/antiharassment-policy)
 - [note-taking at conferences](https://github.com/erinrwhite/ias16-notes)
 - [research and writing](https://github.com/erinrwhite/managing-humans) plus ["github for researchers and writers"](https://github.com/erinrwhite/github-for-researchers)
 - project management: issues, ideas, decision-making processes, paper trail
 - [one-off github pages sites](http://weirdobabe.club/)
 - [forking an existing project](http://erinrwhite.github.io/spritespin/) and using github pages as a dev platform

takeaways: how to get involved
 - **documentation** is the most neglected and yet the most important part of a repository especially for open source projects
    - lots of assumptions built in for open source projects from long-time members of the community - helpful to have fresh eyes from a new contributor to help strengthen the quality of documentation (and thus the project!)
 - **issues/pull requests** can help with user experience considerations, text changes in the interface, or "dumb questions" that are not actually dumb
