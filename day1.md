"Every bad thing that can happen in the real world can now happen on the internet"

Designed community - Columbia, MD

Can you install standards and intention into design so that a system scales? Standards and growth

We are foundational. Design is iterative but foundational work is so important

be intentional about who you put in your comunity; where the roads are. If we can agree that the web needs to live on a foundation of inclusiveness, we can move toward that goal.

things we can do: 
    - don't believe the hype. don't let the unicorns rule
    - do more by doing less. just listen
    - don't wait for anyone's permission to do anything

What is poor design?

 - Right intention, poorly rendered
 - Wrong intention, rendered correctly

Six flags: designs park as activities; Disney designs parks as experiences. Similarly a great design process is designed as an experience.

Designing the design process:

 - Who's on the team?
 - How will they add value?
 - When will they need support?
 - How do we introduce the process?
 - Who gets credit?
 - Who takes the blame?

The most effective design teams worship inclusiveness.

Expectancy bias: if we go into a room thinking some people are expert designers and some are not designers, how does that shape outcomes? 

The design team is *anyone* who influences the rendering of intent.

### Growth stages of understanding
 1. **unconscious incompetence:** we're not good at what we do, don't know how bad we are. Poor outcomes without realizing it
 
 *literacy: sees the difference between good and poor quality* 

  - playbook: start a usability program, teach team, socialize journey maps, start an immersive exposure program (i.e. meet your users!), integrate story mapping

 2. **conscious incompetence** now aware that outcomes are poor quality. Many people stop here.
 
 *fluency: learns how to get good results - repeated practice of procedures*

 - playbook: get secondary influencers into projects early, create a ui controlled vocabulary, create a voice and tone guide, create feature-level personas

 3. **conscious competence** - follows defined procedures to produce good quality outcomes
 
 *mastery: doesn't have to think about it anymore; comprehensive knowledge and craftsmanship for intuitive work*

 4. **unconscious competence** - doesn't need to think about it. Makes good quality outcomes without needing to consider it.

Goal: bring design team to state of understanding about design. Conscious competence at least. But you must come into the room with the expectation that every team member has design potential.

## [not designing for ourselves: US web standards](https://github.com/18F/wds-ia-summit-presentation) from 18f

[US web design standards](https://standards.usa.gov/)

Agencies aren't required to use the standards - needed to incentivize use. Designed pattern library for the way developers would use it!

Find it, get it, question its existence, try to break it, use it

## [life and death UX](http://www.slideshare.net/PaigeTempleton1/life-and-death-ux)

So many people rely on phones as a place of support when in mental health crisis points. Suicide data at afsp.org.

Coping skills - youtube, coloring, mood check-in, journaling, yoga, mindfulness, quotes, support/helplines

Usability testing - sometimes people are under the influence - tested with drunk users. Lots of room to grow for mental health apps, understanding emotional context in design.

## [the architecture of teaching and learning](http://www.slideshare.net/morville/the-architecture-of-teaching-learning-atl) - peter morville

Why should I care? Because we're all teachers. We're teaching all the time. Our interactions with others last longer than any of the digital projects we are building.

What are some strategies for teaching and learning?

Some of mine:
 - taking notes/tweeting
 - teaching others
 - doing it yourself
 - seeing examples
 - saying it out loud
 - understanding bigger context
 - games

Peter pulls from a book [Make it Stick](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013)

**RIGOR**: retrieval, interleaving, garnishing, organization, reflection

**Retrieval** rereading is ineffective. Quizzes/test help with retention. Cumulative learning accrues like compound interest. Practicing something for 10 minutes a day, 6 days a week is a better learning strategy than 1 hour, once a week

**Interleaving** studying various different things rather than variations of the same thing; commonalities are less useful than differences. Mix skills, subjects, problem types. Feels slower, but boosts performance. Sleep enables memory consolidation (spaced practice)

**Garnishing** add meaning by making connections. Explain it in your own words, connect to what you already know, frame in larger context. Memory is like velcro.

**Organize** ideas into mental models. A set of interrelated ideas, a sequence of motor skills. Extract key ideas, define. Make the invisible visible.

**Reflect** what you did, what worked, how might do differently. Spaced retrieval, new connections, metacognition. "People who as a matter of habit extract underlying principles or rules from new experiences are more successful learners". Ask what was the big idea, what was interesting/weird, what was left unanswered?

## cory doctorow

Difference between science and alchemy: alchemists never tell people what they've learned. We put ourselves in computers and computers in ourselves. Proprietary software is alchemy. 

DMCA section 12 copyrighted software on IoT devices. Proprietary software practices spreading throughout internet worlds.

Cryptography/"Security" as "adversarial peer review"

Digital locks are good for preventing competition, not for preventing piracy. They take away features (i.e. DVDs preventing copying)

"If all you can be is a licensor, then we have returned to feudal times"

But more importantly it's about security - it's a process, not a product. But section 12 of DMCA makes it a felony to talk about flaws in a device. IoT devices "reservoir of vulnerabilities". **No one but us** vulnerabilities are accessible to everyone, not just "us".

John Deere - wouldn't give root access on tractors (!) data from soil is sent back to partner vendors i.e. Monsanto => making facts into proprietary facts

Dirt boxes and MC catchers for detecting phone IDs within a geographic area - IoT devices could enable actions against you i.e. turning your Nest down. "What happens when you combine a subprime lender and robotic legs"

"You're all going to wear hearing aids." And they'll be computerized. But we have reached peak indifference. From now on there'll be a massive data breach every 2 weeks and privacy/security will be more of a concern.

**What to do?** Support Apollo 1201 project, trying to end all DRM. Next version of HTML will have DRM?? Spend your money wisely. Donate to organizations that support this mission. Join EFF. Electronic frontier alliance - working with higher ed institutions to educate future computer scientists.
