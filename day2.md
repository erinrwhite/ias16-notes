## [The Inviting Dark: Thinking about Information Architecture In Physical Space](http://lanyrd.com/2016/ias16/sdzmpy/)

### senses
Environments should appeal to multiple senses - Robert Marc's "the 20 senses"

Accessible environments augment everyone's experiences ([Vox coverage of Gallaudet's architecture](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/2/11060484/deaf-university-design-architecture))

For design of spaces, overlay of information is lower-fidelity than reality.

[Calm technology](http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/acmfuture2endnote.htm): more info, less attended to, periphery

[Embodied interactions and emotions](http://www.erikdahl.io/writing/2016/4/19/embodied-interactions-and-emotions)

### circulation

Navigation and orientation: conceptual and physical
Physical spaces have capacity, though

Bitgood: environments should be designed with a minimum number of choice points

People like: open doors, going dark to light, light to dark

Museums have been doing this for a while - design of exhibitions. But visitors rarely do what we think they will.

**how can digital help?** Usage tracking, visitor logs, desire paths

### transitions
[Kuniavsky's spectrum of interaction](http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Things-Ubiquitous-Computing-Experience/dp/0123748992)

Space ranging from super-public to super-private. There is liminal sapce between public and private  - interfaces. Transitions smooth state changes.

You want to *give people choice* and *make it clear what's happening*. Think about timing, use it to reorient and reset expectations.

### maintenance
Things will fail! Make things modular, repairable, sustainable.

Test in the environment, model the environment, reduce the number of variables, plan for the worst.

### story

People forgive if you have a good story. Senses aid story. Story aids transitions and maintenance.

## [personalization @colineags](http://www.slideshare.net/coeagan/colin-eagan-ia-for-personalization-ia-summit-2016)

Targeting = customization based on data - good vs. bad (stalker ads, awkward juxtaposition, inadvertent algorithmic cruelty)

Backlash: more and more people blocking/clearing cookies; ghostery

Experience management tools ($40k+), optimization systems like optimizely (20k+)

When to target: audience can be segmented; narrowed message provides value; targeting tied to organizational objectives

When not to target: because you can

Begin with **intent** - content guiding principles - [colin's ALA](http://alistapart.com/article/approaching-content-strategy-for-personalized-websites)

### segments

determined by data: behavioral traits, demographic traits. Explicit data: logged in with identity management system; implicit data derived from IP address etc.

Implicit data: providers include DemandBase (dark arts??)
Explicit data: coming from a happy place (sure I'll give you this)

Good place to start: ask your users to self-identify

Example: [travel stress](https://hbr.org/web/infographic/2014/04/how-stressful-is-business-travel)

### campaigns/doing the thing

Use cases; experience for each segment - journey maps

pilot campaign ideas: find targetable zones on your site, apply if then statemtents for content

Model of types of personalization:

- alert - time-snsitive info
- make easier - promotion functions for segment
- cross sell - notify of relevant related products or services
- enrich - notify of relevant (non-sales) content

### wrapup

**Still need work if:** you don't have enough content, you don't have staff, your content is not semantically rich, you don't have the CMS, you don't have analytics

**Best practices:** segment traffic on your existing site to set up a baseline; iterate; always be testing (what are the KPIs? how to measure?)

It doesn't have to be complex. The number one method of customer personalization today: email.

## ontology dojo

Ontology: defining/naming things/universe

First define the domain: healthcare, finance, Michigan wines, Walmart inventory?

Objects: things/nouns; concrete vs. abstract

Predicates: actions between objects. "Is part of" is also a predicate (meranyms: parts of a whole)

## multi-year projects

 - broke project into feature groups
 - broke team into groups, defined roles

Tips for survival
 - **be water.** Think about how rivers are formed. Sometimes you run into things you can't go through. Go around it. Be ice when you need to be.
 - **make coffee.** Lead by serving your team. Share, celebrate, show. Create a positive work environment with founding principles. Assume positive intent.
 - **be a dancer.** Lead QA, set the pace, teach the steps
 - **don't expect Everest.** Set realistic goals, understand the challenges. Ask questions
 - **keep track.** Need to document: for yourself, for new team members, for the unexpected. Saves mental fatigue.
 - **conjure creativity.** Do something you love. Get outside your mission. Don't focus on work. Step back, travel, attend conferences.
 - **be a chameleon.** pay attention, adapt to the situation. 

"Please UX yourself first, then UX for others."
